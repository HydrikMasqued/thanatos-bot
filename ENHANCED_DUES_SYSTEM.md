## 🔧 Configuration Requirements

Ensure your server has the following roles configured in the database:
- `full_patch_role_id` - For Full Patch members
- `prospect_role_id` - For Prospect members  
- `officer_role_id` - For officers with management permissions

## 🚨 Important Notes

### Database Methods Required
The system expects these database methods to be available:
- `create_dues_period()`
- `get_dues_period()`
- `get_active_dues_periods()`
- `get_dues_payments_for_period()`
- `update_dues_payment()`
- `update_dues_period_status()`
- `get_server_config()`

### Performance Considerations
- Member dropdowns limited to 25 entries (Discord limitation)
- Pagination used for large member lists
- Efficient role-based filtering
- Async operations with proper error handling
