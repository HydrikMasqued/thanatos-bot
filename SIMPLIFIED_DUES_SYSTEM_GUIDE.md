## 🏆 BEST PRACTICES

### **For Officers**

1. **Use Quick Record for Speed**
   ```
   /dues_quick_record @member amount method status
   ```

2. **Create Periods with Clear Names**
   ```
   /dues_create "Q1 2024 Dues" 25.00 "march 31" "Quarterly membership dues"
   ```

3. **Check Member Perspective**
   - Use `/my_dues` to see what members see
   - Helps ensure accuracy and clarity

4. **Use Natural Language for Dates**
   - "next friday", "end of month", "january 15"
   - Bot parses many formats automatically

### **For Members**

1. **Check Status Regularly**
   ```
   /my_dues
   ```

2. **Use the Main Dashboard**
   ```
   /dues
   ```
   - Interactive interface with helpful buttons
   - Contact information for officers

3. **Pay Attention to Due Dates**
   - Due dates shown in relative format ("in 5 days")
   - Contact officers before due dates if needed

## 🛠️ TROUBLESHOOTING

### **Common Issues**

**Q: The `/dues` command doesn't work**  
A: Make sure you're using the new system. Check that `dues_system_v2` is loaded in main.py

**Q: I can't record payments**  
A: Use `/dues_quick_record` instead of the old `/dues_update_payment` command

**Q: Members can't see the new interface**  
A: The interface adapts to permissions. Members see a simplified view, officers see full tools

**Q: Date parsing isn't working**  
A: Try different formats: "january 15", "2024-01-15", "next friday", "end of month"

### **If Something Goes Wrong**

1. **Check the logs** - Error messages are detailed and helpful
2. **Use fallback commands** - `/my_dues` always works for status checks
3. **Contact support** - All actions are logged for troubleshooting
4. **Restart if needed** - The system is designed to recover gracefully
