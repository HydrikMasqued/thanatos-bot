# 🎉 EVENT SYSTEM ACCESS FIX

**Issue:** Event features not accessible through enhanced menu  
**Root Cause:** Enhanced menu system using incorrect cog references  
**Status:** ✅ **FIXED**

---

## 🔍 **PROBLEM IDENTIFIED**

The event system **was functional** but **not accessible** through the enhanced menu system due to:

1. **Wrong Cog Name:** Enhanced menu was calling `'EventManagement'` instead of `'EventSystem'`
2. **Wrong Method Calls:** Using `.callback()` syntax instead of direct method calls
3. **Missing Analytics Method:** Event analytics method didn't exist, needed custom implementation
4. **Incorrect Command Names:** Command reference list showed wrong command names

---

## ✅ **FIXES APPLIED**

### 1. **Cog Name References Fixed:**
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
events_cog = self.bot.get_cog('EventManagement')

# AFTER (Correct):
events_cog = self.bot.get_cog('EventSystem')
```

### 2. **Method Call Syntax Fixed:**
```python
# BEFORE (Wrong):
await events_cog.list_events.callback(events_cog, interaction)

# AFTER (Correct):  
await events_cog.list_events(interaction)
```

### 3. **Event Analytics Implementation:**
- **Custom Analytics View:** Created comprehensive analytics guidance
- **Command References:** Links to actual analytics commands
- **Feature Overview:** Shows available analytics capabilities

### 4. **Command Names Updated:**
- Updated all command references to match actual event system commands
